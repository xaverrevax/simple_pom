#### The following steps implemented

>1. Based on Page Object Model, create automated test for the scenario: Using Google Translate application (https://translate.google.com/)  

>translated initial text using parameters in the following URL: http://translate.google.com/#auto/{target_lang}/{original_text}


>▪ make sure that the actual translation result in the right field is correct 

>Source, Translation languages, initial text and expected result should be taken from a separate  data file (.json, .yaml, or .xlsx), for example (but not necessarily the exact word!): 

>▪ source language: German 

>▪ translation language: Spanish  

>▪ initial text: "Demokratien"  

>▪ expected result: "Democracias" 

2. Add scenario: click swap languages button and verify the result. 

3. Add scenario: clear the input field, click "select input tool" button, select "screen keyboard" and  enter "Hi!" 

4. Share the link of your framework repository on GitHub with us. It should be public.  

5. Make sure you follow each step precisely. Works in which at least one step is omitted are not  subject to consideration.
